    <p>Hi, my name is Phillip Dunham. I am pretty quiet when I first meet people, but once I have spent a little time with them, I enjoy riffing and joking with them. My ice is a bit thick, but what's underneath is fun and helpful, though often not at the same time. In my free time I run, ideally a few times a week. I have completed 3 marathons as of today, one of which was part of "The Dopey Challenge" which is a four day event in Disney World consisting of a 5k, 10k, half-marathon, and full marathon on subsequent days (Thursday through Sunday). I plan on doing it again in 2023.
